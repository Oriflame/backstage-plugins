/*
  here comes the tricky part. We have json like this:
  {
    ...
    areaScores: [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: "documentation",
        ...
        scoreEntries : [
          {
            id: 222,
            title: "readme"
          },
          {
            id: 333,
            title: "RFP"
          },
          ... other score entries
        ]
      },
      ... other areas with other score entries
    ]
  }
  and we want to have a flat array of score entries for table grouped by area, e.g.
  [
    {
      id: 222,
      title: "readme",
      area: "documentation",
      ...
    },
    {
      id: 333,
      title: "RFP",
      area: "documentation",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
  so we want to basically go through all areaScores and get all its entries to one big array with a new
  property "area" pointing back to the area so we can later on get the area score...

export function getScoreTableEntries(
  value: EntityScoreExtended | null | undefined,
): EntityScoreTableEntry[] {
  if (!value || value.areaScores.length <= 0) return [];
  return value.areaScores.reduce<EntityScoreTableEntry[]>(
    (entries, area) =>
      entries.concat(
        area.scoreEntries.map(entry => {
          return {
            area: area.title,
            ...entry,
          };
        }),
      ),
    [],
  );
